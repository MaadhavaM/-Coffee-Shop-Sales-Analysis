☕ Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis

A Python Data Analytics Project using Pandas, NumPy & Matplotlib

This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing Coffee Shop Sales data to uncover meaningful insights about customer purchasing behavior, price variability, sales trends, and store performance. The analysis is performed using Python and various data science libraries, following multiple structured objectives to extract actionable insights from the dataset.

📌 Project Objectives

This project includes the following analytical objectives:

Compute key statistics such as mean, median, and mode for sales data.

Calculate standard deviation of unit prices, total revenue, and average daily revenue per store.

Analyze the relationship between price and quantity purchased using correlation.

Identify minimum, maximum, and average quantities sold across stores.

Detect outliers in unit price and transaction quantity using the IQR method.

Plot daily revenue trends to identify peaks and patterns.

Evaluate hourly sales performance using bar charts.

Visualize price distribution using histogram + KDE curve.

Analyze impact of unit price on quantity sold using scatter plots.

Compare monthly revenue to understand seasonal trends.
